# Pillars of Eternity Mods

## Description

This is a personal collection of mods that I created for Pillars of Eternity game (1, not Deadfire) and its expansions.

so this is really meant for developers, but feel free to ask for help.
 
## Mods

### Hide panels with hotkey

There is a little arrow that hides the log console and action bar HUD items, but 
there are no keyboard hotkeys for them, which I found to be annoying, so this mod add
them:
- `L` key for hiding the log console.
- `;` key for hiding the action bar.

These hotkeys are fixed and cannot be changed, so don't add them as normal hotkeys
for other things as they will conflict.
